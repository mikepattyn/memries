## Key thesis

Memries is a self-hosted **modular monolith** on Docker Compose (Go chi API, ArangoDB, Dex, Caddy, React SPA). It is not a mikepattyn platform Application, not Clean Architecture, and not a set of microservices.

## Context

The product is an owner-scoped photo library: date-scroll Memories, named Albums, thumbs from disk cache. The umbrella CDK and Authress stacks serve `mikepattyn.nl` apps. This repo needs a recorded answer to “what shape is the system?” so later work does not absorb Memries into platform hosting, split the Go module into services, or grow a second photo catalog beside Arango.

The blueprint is the source for this ADR. It inspected `go.mod`, Compose, `internal/*`, and the SPA. Prefer later ADRs and the code when they disagree with the blueprint (see Limitations).

## Decision

- **Process shape.** One Go module, two binaries: `cmd/server` (HTTP) and `cmd/indexer` (CLI). The server also runs the indexer package in-process for `POST /api/index`. Manual wiring in `main`; chi; env `MEMRIES_*`; no DI container.
- **Persistence.** ArangoDB documents (`photos`, `users`, `albums`) with owner filters in AQL. Edge collections for sharing stay schema-only until a sharing ADR. Hexagonal only at `storage.Storage` (`local` now; `s3` is a factory error until Phase 3).
- **Edge and identity.** Caddy `:80` splits `/api` and `/oauth` to the API, `/` to the SPA. Dex listens on host `:5556` (not behind Caddy) so browser and backend share issuer `http://localhost:5556`; backend uses `extra_hosts: localhost:host-gateway`. Browser authz is the `memries` cookie session, not a SPA bearer token.
- **UI.** React composition, no router library; tabs are state. Photos load through authenticated `/api` (`credentials: "include"`; 401 → `/oauth/login`). Granularity grouping stays in `groupPhotos`.
- **Hosting.** Local Compose only. No CDK stack, no K8s. Do not add Memries to `infra/cdk/` unless a later ADR says so.

### Considered options

| Option | Why not |
| ------ | ------- |
| Absorb into platform CDK / Authress | Different remote, Compose ops, Dex already in-tree |
| Next.js (or similar) full-stack | API, indexer, and thumb pipeline are already Go |
| Stay on Piwigo | The point of the rewrite |
| Postgres instead of Arango | Timeline AQL and a reserved sharing graph were the bet; swapping storage is a new ADR |
| Microservices | One operator, one library; extra network hops buy nothing in Phase 1 |

## Key findings

1. **The only real port is Storage.** `db` and `auth` are concrete types. New object stores belong behind `storage.New`; do not teach `api` about S3.
2. **ACL is query-time `owner_id`.** List/timeline AQL filters the Owner; by-id routes must still compare `OwnerID` after `GetPhoto`. Sharing must replace that filter in `db`, not in handlers.
3. **Caddy and Dex are a deliberate cycle break.** Putting Dex behind Caddy without a new issuer/discovery story will fail backend boot (`depends_on` vs OIDC discovery). That constraint is operational, not visible in Go types.
4. **The SPA talks to `/api`, not a Vite disk catalog.** `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` maps `_key` → `id` and `/api/thumb` + `/api/original`. A leftover blueprint sentence that still says “frontend data lives inside Vite” is stale.

## Methodology

Architecture detection from project files (Compose, Dockerfiles, `go.mod`, `package.json`, chi routes, AQL, Vite proxy). No runtime profile, no load test. Inferred “ADR-M*” items in the blueprint are working notes, not numbered decisions — except the stack/shape call recorded here.

## Consequences

- New features stay in `internal/<concern>` and SPA `components` / `hooks` / `lib` / `models`. Do not add `internal/services`.
- Originals go through `Storage`; thumbs stay a filesystem cache (`MEMRIES_CACHE_ROOT`) until an explicit move.
- Cookie session remains the `/api` authz mechanism. Do not put access tokens in `localStorage`.
- Photo **identity** and **TakenAt** are not defined here — see [0005](0005-capture-time-stable-identity.md). Compact thumb sizes are [0007](0007-viewport-forced-compact-thumbs.md). Clearing Arango without wiping volumes is [0006](0006-truncate-arango-for-resync.md).

## Limitations

- The blueprint mixed a first snapshot (Vite `virtual:memries-photos` / `mockApi`) with a later API-wired SPA. This ADR follows the code and blueprint §1, not the stale “inside Vite” line in §2.
- Blueprint ADR-M3 (SHA-256 as `_key` forever) is **superseded** by 0005 (path-first identity; hash is a fingerprint).
- Blueprint ADR-M4 (two independent clocks) is **refined** by 0005 (`ResolveCaptureTime` + `taken_at_local` in the UI).
- No automated architecture tests. Import rules are social.
- Source has no external peer review; it is a generated map of this repo.

## Actionable takeaways

- When adding a backend, implement `storage.Storage`; do not add a second catalog (SQLite beside Arango, or a Vite JSON library beside `/api/photos`).
- When adding a JSON route, mount it under `/api` behind session middleware and keep owner checks in `db` or on the loaded document.
- When the blueprint and a numbered ADR disagree, trust the numbered ADR, then the code.

## Quality

| Dimension   | Rating | Note |
| ----------- | ------ | ---- |
| Credibility | Medium | First-party generated report, not a locked grill |
| Evidence    | High   | Matches Compose, `cmd/server`, `lib/api.ts` |
| Recency     | High   | Source 2026-08-25; accepted 2026-08-26 |
| Objectivity | Medium | Generator enumerates inferred ADRs; some sections drifted |

**Overall:** Adequate for **stack and process shape**. Do not cite it for Photo identity, capture time, or thumb density.
